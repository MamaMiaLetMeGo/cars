I want to be able to filter the cars by the state but I am unable to figure it out. Currently, you can filter the cars by the make and order. I think the problem has to do with something in the cars controller or something to do with a div id.

Fix: 2
Minor problem - images not appearing when updating or adding thumbnail to cars.
