3 Fixes needed!
Fix: 1
Within _form.html.erb (car views), I need to fix f.input :description, as: :rich_text_area because the rich text editor does not show on the show.html.erb.

Fix: 2
Need f.collection_select for Make and State on _form.html.erb (car views) to show as a dropdown. As of now it allows the user to multiselect when creating or editing a new car.

Fix: 3
State not appearing on the index.html.erb (car views). Currently the image, title, color, price, and year is showing correctly but I can't figure out how to get the State to show.
